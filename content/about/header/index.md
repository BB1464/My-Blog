Thanks for stopping by!!!  

My name is **Oluwafemi Oyedele** and I am a data analyst and R studio instructor. During the past few years, I discovered the power of the statistical programming language R. Since then I have turned into a big enthusiast, using the software almost every day for work and many private programming projects. I love analyzing data and making beautiful charts with R and I have mentored countless students and scientists in everything from experimental design to using R for creating figures for their publication. I obtained my first degree from the University of Calabar in 2015 (Magna Cum Laude), and an MSc from the University of Ibadan in 2021, Specialization in Agrometeorology.
